# Bootstrap and Python for statistical inference

This repository contains a few examples of how to perform statistical inference with the bootstrap method. I have largely taken inspiration from the article by Rousselet, Pernet and Wilcox, "A practical introduction to the bootstrap: a versatile method to make inferences by using data-driven simulations" ([Rousselet et al., PsyArXiv:h8ft7 preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/h8ft7/)). With the paper, they provide examples and code in R. Here, I use Python to run the bootstrap simulations and generate similar plots.
